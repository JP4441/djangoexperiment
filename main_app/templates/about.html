    <h1>About the Finchs</h1>

    <h4>
      The true finches are small to medium-sized passerine birds in the family
      Fringillidae. Finches have stout conical bills adapted for eating seeds
      and nuts and often have colourful plumage. They occupy a great range of
      habitats where they are usually resident and do not migrate. They have a
      worldwide distribution except for Australia and the polar regions. The
      family Fringillidae contains more than two hundred species divided into
      fifty genera. It includes species known as siskins, canaries, redpolls,
      serins, grosbeaks and euphonias.
